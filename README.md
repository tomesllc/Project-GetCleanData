Project repository for project associated with Johns Hopkins Getting and Cleaning
Data Mooc course. There are 4 files in this repository:

 * README.md  -  This document
 * Codebook.md - A markup document detailing the source data, manipulations and 
 output
 * run_analysis.R - The R code file for manipulating and generation of a tidy 
 data file
 * Project_Tidy_Data.txt - An example output file
 
# Use of the files #

## Input Files ##
The Project_Tidy_Data.txt file is generated by the run_analysis.R script. It 
requires four 6 input files:
 
1. X_test.txt
2. y_test.txt
3. subject_test.txt
4. X_train.txt
5. y_train.txt
6. subject_train.txt

These files are in the zipped file available at:

## Script Execution ##

Place the 6 input files listed above and the run_analysis.R script in a common
directory. Execute the complete R script. It will take a few minutes to run, 
primarily spent in reading in the input files.

## Script Output $$

The R script will generate an output file named "Project_Tidy_Data.txt". This
file should be a space delimited txt file of 180 rows by 66 columns in size.
